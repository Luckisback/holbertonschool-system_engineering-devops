### ` General `


 *   A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
 *   For each task, once you are done whiteboarding (on a whiteboard, piece of paper or software or your choice), take a picture/screenshot of your diagram
 *   This project will be manually reviewed:
 *   As each task is completed, the name of that task will turn green
 *   Upload a screenshot, showing that you completed the required levels, to any image hosting service (I personally use imgur but feel free to use anything you want).
 *   For the following tasks, insert the link from of your screenshot into the answer file
 *   After pushing your answer file to GitHub, insert the GitHub file link into the URL box
 *   You will also have to whiteboard each task in front of a mentor, staff or student - no computer or notes will be allowed during the whiteboarding session
 *   Focus on what you are being asked:
 *   Cover what the requirements mention, we will explore details in a later project
 *   Keep in mind that you will have 30 minutes to perform the exercise, you will get points for what is asked in requirements
 *   Similarly in a job interview, you should answer what the interviewer asked for, be careful about being too verbose - always ask the interviewer if going into details is necessary - speaking too much can play against you
 *   In this project, again, avoid going in details if not asked
